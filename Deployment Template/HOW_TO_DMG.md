# How to create DMG

1. Have a look at an old release in the folder `old` as an example.
2. Copy the folder `ACShell-VERSIONNUMBER`
3. Add version number to the name like so, `ACShell-2.4.1`
4. Add your built executable to this folder
5. Open `Disk Utility`, select `New Disk Image from Folder`
6. Make sure you like the name of the DMG that is about to be created.
7. Image Format should be `read/write`
8. Encryption should be `none`
9. After creation, open the DMG and in the Finder select `Show View Options`
10. Change the settings following the screenshot dmg_settings. `Always open in icon view` and `Browse in icon view`. `Adjust Icon Size` and as background add the `installer_background.png`. Move the application and application folder icon until it pleases your eye.
11. Settings should be saved automatically, you're done!
