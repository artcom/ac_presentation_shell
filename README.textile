h1. ART+COM Presentation Shell

The ART+COM presentation shell is a frontend to manage, organize and launch a pool of Apple Keynote presentations. The presentation library is synchronized with a central server using @rsync@. Presentations are grouped in collections, similar to playlists in iTunes. In presentation mode a slick menu screen is used to navigate and launch presentations.

How to setup the Application is described in the "project wiki":https://github.com/artcom/ac_presentation_shell/wiki
